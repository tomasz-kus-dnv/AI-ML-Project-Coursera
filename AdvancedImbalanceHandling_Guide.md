# Advanced Class Imbalance Handling for Wind Turbine Fault Detection

## Summary of Implemented Techniques

This document provides a comprehensive overview of advanced class imbalance handling techniques implemented for wind turbine fault detection using SCADA data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Context

Wind turbine fault detection faces severe class imbalance challenges:
- **Normal operations**: 95-99% of data
- **Fault conditions**: 1-5% of data
- **Critical requirement**: High recall (cannot miss faults)
- **Business impact**: Missing a fault can cost $50k-$500k in repairs

## ðŸš€ Advanced Techniques Implemented

### 1. **Adaptive Threshold Classifier**
**Purpose**: Adjusts decision thresholds based on local data density and neighborhood characteristics.

**How it works**:
- Calculates local density for each training sample
- Determines different optimal thresholds for different density regions
- Applies adaptive thresholds during prediction based on test sample density

**Best for**: 
- Data with varying noise levels
- Non-uniform class distributions
- Scenarios where different regions require different sensitivity

**Code Usage**:
```python
from AdvancedImbalanceHandling import AdaptiveThresholdClassifier

adaptive_clf = AdaptiveThresholdClassifier(
    base_classifier=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),
    adaptation_method='density',
    n_neighbors=5
)
adaptive_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = adaptive_clf.predict(X_test)
```

### 2. **Dynamic Sampling Strategy**
**Purpose**: Automatically selects the best sampling technique based on data characteristics and performance feedback.

**How it works**:
- Analyzes data characteristics (imbalance ratio, dimensionality, noise level)
- Chooses initial sampling strategy based on analysis
- Adapts strategy based on performance feedback from previous iterations
- Learns which techniques work best for different data patterns

**Best for**:
- Scenarios with changing data patterns
- When you're unsure which sampling technique to use
- Long-term deployments that need to adapt over time

**Code Usage**:
```python
from AdvancedImbalanceHandling import DynamicSamplingStrategy

dynamic_sampler = DynamicSamplingStrategy()
X_resampled, y_resampled, strategy = dynamic_sampler.adaptive_sample(X_train, y_train)

# Train model with resampled data
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)

# Record performance for future adaptation
performance = {'f1_score': f1, 'precision': precision, 'recall': recall}
dynamic_sampler.record_performance(performance)
```

### 3. **Multi-Objective Threshold Optimization**
**Purpose**: Finds optimal thresholds considering multiple objectives (F1, recall, cost) simultaneously.

**How it works**:
- Evaluates multiple thresholds across different metrics
- Uses weighted combination of objectives
- Finds Pareto-optimal solutions
- Considers business costs of different types of errors

**Best for**:
- When you need to balance multiple competing objectives
- Business scenarios with clear cost structures
- Regulatory requirements for specific performance metrics

**Code Usage**:
```python
from AdvancedImbalanceHandling import MultiObjectiveThresholdOptimizer

optimizer = MultiObjectiveThresholdOptimizer(
    objectives=['f1_score', 'recall', 'total_cost'],
    weights=[1.0, 1.5, 2.0]  # Prioritize cost and recall
)

optimal_thresholds, results = optimizer.optimize_threshold(
    y_test, y_proba, cost_matrix={'fn_cost': 15, 'fp_cost': 1}
)

# Use optimal threshold for predictions
best_threshold = optimal_thresholds['multi_objective']
y_pred_optimized = (y_proba >= best_threshold).astype(int)
```

### 4. **Hybrid Sampling Ensemble**
**Purpose**: Combines multiple sampling techniques with different base models and uses meta-learning.

**How it works**:
- Applies different sampling strategies to create diverse datasets
- Trains different base models on each resampled dataset
- Uses meta-learning to combine predictions optimally
- Leverages diversity for better generalization

**Best for**:
- Maximum performance scenarios
- When computational resources allow for ensemble methods
- Complex datasets with multiple patterns

**Code Usage**:
```python
from AdvancedImbalanceHandling import HybridSamplingEnsemble

hybrid_ensemble = HybridSamplingEnsemble(
    base_models=[RandomForestClassifier(), ExtraTreesClassifier(), 
                 GradientBoostingClassifier()],
    sampling_strategies={'SMOTE': SMOTE(), 'ADASYN': ADASYN()}
)

hybrid_ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = hybrid_ensemble.predict(X_test)
```

### 5. **Context-Aware Cost-Sensitive Learning**
**Purpose**: Adjusts misclassification costs based on operational context (season, weather, maintenance windows).

**How it works**:
- Defines base costs for false positives and false negatives
- Adjusts costs based on operational context (weather, season, demand)
- Trains models with dynamic class weights
- Adapts to changing operational conditions

**Best for**:
- Real-world deployments with varying operational conditions
- When misclassification costs change based on context
- Integration with operational planning systems

**Code Usage**:
```python
from AdvancedImbalanceHandling import CostSensitiveLearning

cost_learner = CostSensitiveLearning()
cost_learner.set_operational_context({
    'season': 'winter',
    'wind_speed': 18,
    'maintenance_window': False,
    'turbine_age': 12,
    'grid_demand': 'high'
})

model, costs = cost_learner.train_cost_sensitive_model(X_train, y_train)
```

### 6. **Ensemble Diversity Techniques**
**Purpose**: Creates ensembles that maximize diversity while handling class imbalance.

**How it works**:
- Uses different base models with varying hyperparameters
- Applies different sampling strategies to each model
- Measures and maximizes ensemble diversity
- Combines predictions using optimized weighting

**Best for**:
- When you want robust predictions
- Scenarios requiring high reliability
- Complex datasets with multiple fault patterns

### 7. **Focal Loss for Imbalanced Classification**
**Purpose**: Uses focal loss to automatically focus learning on hard-to-classify samples.

**How it works**:
- Applies higher weights to misclassified samples
- Reduces weight of well-classified samples
- Iteratively refines sample weights
- Naturally handles class imbalance

**Best for**:
- Deep learning scenarios
- When you want automatic hard sample mining
- Datasets with extreme imbalance

### 8. **Progressive Sampling Strategy**
**Purpose**: Gradually reduces class imbalance through multiple training stages.

**How it works**:
- Starts with highly imbalanced data
- Progressively reduces imbalance ratio
- Trains models at each stage
- Combines stage models with appropriate weighting

**Best for**:
- Very large datasets
- When computational resources are limited
- Scenarios requiring gradual adaptation

### 9. **Meta-Learning for Technique Selection**
**Purpose**: Automatically recommends the best imbalance handling technique based on dataset characteristics.

**How it works**:
- Extracts meta-features from the dataset
- Uses rules or learned models to recommend techniques
- Considers dataset complexity, imbalance ratio, and other factors
- Provides confidence scores for recommendations

**Best for**:
- Automated machine learning pipelines
- When domain expertise is limited
- Rapid prototyping and experimentation
